    dear internet,
  </h1>
  <p>
    thanks. thanks for being so useful, so convenient, so available. thanks for always being there, answering any question i could possibly think of. because of you, i can stay connected with people far away, spending time with people important to me even if theyre not by my side. there’s never a boring moment with you, always something to do whether that’s playing games, watching a show, or even doing homework.

    did you know how vast you would become?
  </p>
  <p>
    did you know what effect you would have on future generations?
  </p>
  <p>
    despite the positive influence youve had on my livelihood, youve played a part in negatively affecting others. without you, cyberbullying wouldnt exist, peoples privacy and information would be more secure, peoples thoughts wouldnt constantly be prodded by multimillion dollar companies. i've even heard that you might take over the world soon. the development of artificial intelligence has pushed the bounds of what is possible with computers, which is both exciting and scary.
  </p>
  <p>
    i wonder what more is coming…
