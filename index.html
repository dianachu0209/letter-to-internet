    dear internet,
  </h1>
  <p>
  thanks. thanks for being so useful, so convenient, so available. thanks for always being the`re, answering any question i could possibly think of. because of you, i can stay connected with people far away, spending time with people important to me even if theyre not by my side. there’s never a boring moment with you, always something to do whether that’s playing games, watching a show, doing homework.

  did you know how vast you would become?
  </p>
  <p>
  did you know what effect you would have on future generations?
  </p>
  <p>
  despite the positive influence youve had on my livelihood, youve played a part in negatively affecting others. without you, cyberbullying wouldnt exist, peoples privacy and information would be more secure, peoples thoughts wouldnt constantly be prodded by multimillion dollar companies.

  <p>
  i wonder what more is coming…
