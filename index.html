    dear internet,
  </h1>
  <p>
    thanks. thanks for being so useful, so convenient, so available. thanks for always being there, answering any question i could possibly think of. because of you, i can stay connected with people far away, spending time with people important to me even if theyre not by my side. there’s never a boring moment with you, always something to do whether that’s <a href="https://www.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/download/" target="_blank">playing games</a>, <a href="https://www.netflix.com/" target="_blank">watching a show</a>, or even <a href="https://canvas.uchicago.edu/" target="_blank">doing homework</a>.

    <a href="https://www.worldwidewebsize.com/" target="_blank">did you know how vast you would become?</a>

  </p>
  <p>
    despite the positive influence youve had on my livelihood, youve played a part in negatively affecting others. without you, cyberbullying wouldnt exist, peoples privacy and information would be more secure, peoples thoughts wouldnt constantly be prodded by multimillion dollar companies.

    i wonder what more is coming…
